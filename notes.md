First commits, first tries of functions & fetching. We took the treasure hunts available from the server
and we managed to get the user name and submit it but also print the appropriate message when an error is occurred.
As we finished with /start and /list we moved forward to the question api and we were able to get the questions
from the server .

Dec 5, 2019
We had our Feedback #2 where we had to fix some Styling issues improve our HCI and we started 
implementing the testing api. 


As a team we tried to work all together on the assignment, and every time we meet we tried to work
together to help each other with the ideas that we had. We worked a lot as a team and we tried to meet
every day for the last 3 weeks in order to finalise and prepare our project. Kyriakos had the most important
job as he was responsible for the JS with the help of Nikos. Andreas Zavros took the responsibility of 
the landing page as well as the styling of the Treasure Hunt app. Nikos was also responsible for the testing
with the help of Kyriakos. As we found difficulties on a lot of things on our app our contribution to each other
was really helpful and we manage to go through this problems really quickly and effectively.
